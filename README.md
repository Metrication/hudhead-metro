### hudhead region

hudhead is a large fictional peninsula in the cumbria region of england, extending out from walney island. the concept is borrowed from the island of sodor in thomas the tank engine. the heightmap is actually derived from the island of menorca in spain, then rotated and merged into a heightmap of the north west region of england. the heightmap is scaled correctly, at 2048x1024 pixels, with a single pixel representing 20x20 metre square. this will serve as the basis for all measurements, including train line distances, train speed etc. the principle settlement on the peninsula is the city of hudhead, a large former steel and port town.
